### CUNY MSDA Summer 2015 Bridge Workshop SQL Final Project

**Overview **
1. I designed a database for people who are self_managing their own investment accounts, which could be at different brokers;

2. This database includes 6 tables: users,brokers,accounts,categories,actions,transactions and 1 Views (all_information), which includes all the information from 6 tables;

3. At the end, I show some queries to showcase how to use this database.
